      Hi! I am Domna, I am a geospatial engineer and I like to explore the world, the cities and the peopleâ€™s movement
      through cartography, spatial analysis, and coding!
      <br>
      <br>
      I hold an Integrated Master in Spatial Planning and Development Engineering from the Aristotle University
      of Thessaloniki and in a couple of months I will hold a Master of Science in GIS through Lund University, Sweden.
      <br>
      <br>
      In 2019 I decided to enroll in a one-year specialization program in Modern Computer Applications and I realized
      that wonderful things could happen combining GIS and modern web technologies!
      <br>
      <br>
      This is my portfolio which includes web-GIS applications, cartography, and spatial analysis projects!
